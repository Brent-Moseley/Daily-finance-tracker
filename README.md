# Daily-finance-tracker Showcase App

This cloud-based website is a MEAN stack application (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node JS) that is deployed online, is responsive, and is meant to be a useful tool for helping people to track their monthly budgets. It allows the user to conveniently enter their expenses as they go about their day and week (just pull up the website on a phone browser for easy entry) and has a variety of easy ways to add up expenses. There are standard as well as user-defined expense categories.  Anyone who wants to play around with the app can either try out the sample account (demo123), or create their own for free, personal use.  In the near future, I will be adding report charts,  an export function, and greatly increased TDD coverage.  All code for this project is on this public github repo (https://github.com/Brent-Moseley/Daily-finance-tracker), and gives a great recent example of my coding style in MEAN stack.
